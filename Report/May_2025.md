- Videos longer than 3 minutes delivered 43,896 views in the 1,000+ view bracket, making long-form content the best-performing format.
- However, 1â€“2 min videos were most common among 10,000+ view range, offering a balance of attention span and value.

 - Caption types (CTA vs descriptive)
 - Post time (10 AM vs 3 PM)
