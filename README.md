# REAL TIME TIKTOK POSTS ANALYSIS AND ENGAGEMENT INSIGHTS
Since launching my TikTok content journey in October 2024, I have maintained a data-driven approach to track the performance of my posts. Using an automated Power BI dashboard that updates in real-time, I analyzed engagement metrics to understand what content resonates most with my audience. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total views, average engagement, engagement rate, and average playtime were closely monitored to guide strategic content decisions.

# DATA SOURCE & EXTRACTION PROCESS
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from TikTok through the ScrapTik API. Data extraction and processing were performed using Python, and the final output was saved as a CSV file for analysis.
Below is an overview of the steps taken to ensure the dataset remains up-to-date with both existing and new posts:

* API Request: A request was sent to the TikTok API endpoint using my unique user_id to retrieve post data.

* Read Existing Data: The script first reads from the existing CSV file and identifies already stored posts using their post_id.
![TT python](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9330ea3-cd45-4df6-b183-54d82f242e41)

* Fetch New Data: A JSON request is made to retrieve additional data from the TikTok profile, if available.
![TT python2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c091870-0e79-4acb-ac90-b88d8a05fe6c)

* Update and Merge: Existing posts are updated with any new metrics, and new posts are appended to the dataset.
![TT python3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b42c93e0-96b3-4355-9160-833b28de00ee)

* Data Formatting: The updated and newly fetched posts are processed and formatted uniformly.

* Save as CSV: The final, merged dataset is saved as a CSV file for further analysis in Power BI.

# TOOLS
Python: This was used requesting for the data from Tiktok, transforming, updating and converting the data from Json to CSV file
Power BI: Employed for the main analysis and data visualization, enabling the extraction of key insights through DAX measures and visual tools.

# DATA PROCESSING
Data Preparation in Power BI:
After loading the cleaned data into Power BI, the following transformations and enhancements were made:

* Date column breakdown: Date was extracted from Date/Time column

* Creation of some new columns for dax formulars:
     Engagement Rate per post column

# LIMITATIONS
* The analysis focuses on likes, comments, shares, and views. It does not include follower growth, saves, watch-through rate, or audience demographics, which are key for a deeper understanding.

* While the correlation of 0.37 is useful, it only measures linear relationships. Non-linear relationships between video attributes and engagement may have been missed.

* Since the dashboard updates in real-time, metrics can shift daily, making it necessary to freeze data points when presenting or comparing over time.

* The analysis did not fully separate the effects of captions, hashtags, or sound usage, which are known to impact discoverability and engagement.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
* Continue to create content around career advice, data skills, and freelancing stories, as these clearly drive engagement.

* Post content between 9 AM ‚Äì 12 PM, especially on Mondays and Thursdays, to align with peak user activity.

* Keep creating videos over 3 minutes‚Äîthey not only drive higher views but also give you more room to educate, engage, and build trust.

* Experiment with different caption lengths, tones, and CTA styles to determine what boosts engagement per post.

* Explore Data Beyond Engagement: Which are Follower growth over time, Audience retention, Most effective sound trends, Performance of posts by format (e.g., storytelling vs. tutorial)

* Implement a snapshot report at the start of each month to track changes and prevent real-time data shifts from skewing insights.
